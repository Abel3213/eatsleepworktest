As the user, to access the information on the website you will have to sign up first. If you are a returning user log in instead. The user will then be able to see different tabs spanning from Workout, Eat, and Sleep. Each tab will take you to a page specific to the name. The homepage will present the user's avatar, workout, meal, and sleep cards for the user to input their data. There is a contact page if the user wants to contact the developers via email, and a logout button.
